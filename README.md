# Park-or-bird
In computer science, it can be difficult to explain the difference between the easy and the virtually impossible\cite{cite1}. We were inspired by an xkcd comic to take the “park or bird” challenge using Spark and MLlib. Our goal is to build a scalable system for image processing: ingesting raw images, converting images to machine learning features, training a classifier, and ultimately building a deployable scalable prediction engine based on Spark.
