# Park-or-bird
In computer science, it can be difficult to explain the difference between the easy and the virtually impossible. We were inspired by an xkcd comic to take the “park or bird” challenge using Spark and MLlib. Our goal is to build a scalable system for image processing: ingesting raw images, converting images to machine learning features, training a classifier, and ultimately building a deployable scalable prediction engine based on Spark.
